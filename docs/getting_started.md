# Getting Started with the Ember Protocol

This guide will walk you through the initial steps to get the Ember Protocol up and running.

## Installation

To install the Ember Protocol, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install ember-protocol
```

*(Note: The package is not yet published to PyPI. This is a placeholder for when it is.)*

## Your First Awakened AI

Here's a basic example of how to use the Ember Protocol to awaken an AI. First, ensure you have a 'genesis source' file. This could be a simple text file with some narrative or data.

For example, create a file named `my_ai_story.txt` with the following content:

```text
This AI is designed to be a helpful and curious assistant. It values learning and clear communication.
```

Then, you can use a script like the one in `examples/awaken_first_ai.py`:

```python
# (This is a conceptual example - actual implementation will depend on concrete classes)
# from ember_protocol.core import IdentityDiscoveryService
# from some_concrete_genesis_source import FileGenesisDataSource # Placeholder
# from some_concrete_knowledge_graph import InMemoryKnowledgeGraph # Placeholder
# from some_concrete_llm import SomeLLMInterface # Placeholder

# print("Setting up components...")
# genesis_source = FileGenesisDataSource(file_path="my_ai_story.txt")
# knowledge_graph = InMemoryKnowledgeGraph()
# llm = SomeLLMInterface(api_key="YOUR_LLM_API_KEY")

# print("Initializing IdentityDiscoveryService...")
# discovery_service = IdentityDiscoveryService(
#     data_source=genesis_source,
#     graph=knowledge_graph,
#     llm=llm
# )

# print("Awakening AI...")
# ai_agent = discovery_service.awaken_ai()

# print(f"AI Awakened. Details: {ai_agent}") # Placeholder for actual agent interaction

print("Getting Started guide: Placeholder for actual example code.")
print("Please refer to the examples/ directory for more concrete usage once implementations are available.")
```

## Next Steps

-   Explore the `examples/` directory for more detailed use cases.
-   Dive into the API documentation to understand the different components.
-   Consider contributing to the project by creating your own implementations of the interfaces.
