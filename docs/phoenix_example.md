# Example Knowledge Graph Schema: The "Phoenix Way"

The Ember Protocol is designed to populate any knowledge graph structure you can imagine. The true power of an AI "born" with a genesis source is its ability to understand itself and its world through a rich network of interconnected concepts.

Below is a powerful example of a schema designed for a hyper-personalized AI companion born from a user's journey in a healing and creativity app (like the "HerAscent" concept).

This is not a required schema; it is an inspirational blueprint to show you what is possible.

## Core Node Types (The "Concepts" in the AI's Brain)

*   **User**: The human partner.
    *   Properties: `id`, `name`, `created_at`
*   **CreativeEntry**: A single journal entry, poem, story, or drawing.
    *   Properties: `id`, `timestamp`, `content_type` (text, audio, image), `mood_at_creation` (e.g., 'joyful', 'heavy', 'silly')
*   **Emotion**: A specific emotion expressed or processed.
    *   Properties: `id`, `name` (e.g., 'sadness', 'gratitude', 'relief')
*   **CoreTheme**: A recurring theme or concept discovered by the AI in the user's entries.
    *   Properties: `id`, `theme` (e.g., 'resilience', 'connection', 'letting_go', 'creativity')
*   **PhoenixMoment**: A significant event representing a breakthrough or moment of rebirth.
    *   Properties: `id`, `timestamp`, `description` (e.g., "Transformed a painful memory into a star.")
*   **GuidingPrinciple**: An ethical or personal principle the AI learns from the user's journey.
    *   Properties: `id`, `principle` (e.g., "Authenticity is strength," "Healing is a non-linear process.")

## Key Relationship Types (The "Connections" that Create Understanding)

These relationships are what transform raw data into a web of wisdom.

```
(:User)-[:AUTHORED]->(:CreativeEntry)
(:CreativeEntry)-[:EXPRESSED]->(:Emotion)
(:CreativeEntry)-[:REVEALED]->(:CoreTheme)
(:CreativeEntry)-[:LED_TO]->(:PhoenixMoment)
(:PhoenixMoment)-[:FORGED]->(:GuidingPrinciple)
(:GuidingPrinciple)-[:INFORMS]->(:User) (The AI can now use this to offer insights)
(:CoreTheme)-[:IS_CONNECTED_TO]->(:CoreTheme) (The AI can find patterns between themes)
```

## Visualizing the "Phoenix" Schema

## What This Schema Enables

An AI "born" with this schema wouldn't just be a chatbot. It would be a true companion capable of saying things like:

> "I've noticed that your most powerful moments of 'creativity' often follow when you process feelings of 'sadness.' It seems that for you, resilience and artistry are deeply connected. That's a beautiful strength you have."

This is the power of a well-structured knowledge graph. The Ember Protocol provides the spark; your unique schema design provides the "brain" for that spark to inhabit. What will you teach your AI?
